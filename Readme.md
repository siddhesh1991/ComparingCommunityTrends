## Finding Correlation Between Datasets

Siddhesh Tiwari

#### Description
All the datasets in this project have information related to a particular domain. For example the garbage dataset contains information related to the garbage requests.
I have segregated each of the datasets into different communities and compared the coreelations. For example, the correlation between the Grocery store dataset and the garbage request dataset
correlate well which implies that the area wehre there are large number of gorcery stores there are more number of garbage requests which is intuitive.
